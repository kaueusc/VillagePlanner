# Village Planner

## Getting started (running the application):
- **Make sure that you choose a pixel 2 device that allows google play services integration**
- Download a virtual Pixel 2 device with an API level of 24.
- Use Nougat as the Android OS version
- Run the application
- When first starting the application from android studio, the emulator may ask you to enable google play services, accept this message so that Andriod will redirect you to the Google Play store to download and enable Google Play Services for your device.
- Note that installing google play services may require you to sign into your google account on the emulator.
- Finally, sign up using the sign up page on the onboarding pages of the application or log in using an existing account.
- Now the app should be running! ü•≥

## Basic feature

## Feature 1: Maps feature
- Click on the marker corresponding to the place within the village that you would like to navigate to.

## Feature 2: Wait time estimation
- When on the maps page of the application, you will see marker icons showing the estimated wait time for each place on the map.
